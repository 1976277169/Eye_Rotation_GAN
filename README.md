# Introduction

Eye rotation has a wide range of applications in the real life. For example,
this techniques can be applied for eye attention rectification for formal
personal or group photograph. We do not found effective methods for this problem.
In this paper, we proposed a new eye rotation algorithm for fast
eye attention rectification using a end-to-end networks. Our method is based on the
idea of eye in-painting and leverage encode-decode networks to learn the mapping from
the input facial image with the eye mask to the facial image with correct eye attention.
We use adversarial loss to improve the visual quality of generated samples. Moreover,
we propose a self-guided method to preserve the identity information of the in-painted images.
A new dataset has been collected for training and will be introduced in details.
